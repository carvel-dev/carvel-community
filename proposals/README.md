# Carvel Proposals
This directory serves as the home for Carvel proposals. A proposal is a design
document that describes a new feature for a Carvel project. The new feature
can span multiple projects or introduce a new project. 
A proposal must be sponsored by at least one Carvel Maintainer.  Proposals can be worked by anyone in the community.

# Submit a Proposal
To create a proposal, submit a PR to this directory under the appropriate
project with a terse name (for example, `ytt/001-schemas/`). If the proposal concerns multiple projects or is
intended for the entire Carvel suite then please create the proposal at the root
of the `proposals` directory (for example, `./010-carvel-cli/`).

When creating the proposal, please add a `Status: Draft` line at the top of the
proposal to indicate its state.

# Proposal Review
Once a proposal PR is submitted, project maintainers will review the proposal.
The goal of the review is to gain an understanding of the problem being solved
and the design of the proposed solution.
