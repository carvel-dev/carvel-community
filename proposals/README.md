# Carvel Proposals
This directory serves as the home for Carvel proposals. A proposal is a design
document that describes a new feature for a Carvel project. The new feature
can span multiple projects or introduce a new project. Proposals are primarily
intended for maintainers but are open to the community for collaboration.

# Submit a Proposal
To create a proposal, submit a PR to this directory under the appropriate
project (for example, `ytt`). If the proposal concerns multiple projects or is
intended for the entire Carvel suite then please create the proposal at the root
of the `proposals` directory.

When creating the proposal, please add a `Status: Draft` line at the top of the
proposal to indicate its state.

# Proposal Review
Once a proposal PR is submitted, project maintainers will review the proposal.
The goal of the review is to gain an understanding of the problem being solved
and the design of the proposed solution.
