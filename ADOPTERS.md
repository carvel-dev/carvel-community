If you are using Carvel and would like to be included in the list of Carvel Adopters, add an SVG version of your logo to
the `adopters` directory in this repo and submit a pull request with your change. Name the image file something that
reflects your company (e.g., if your company is called Acme, name the image acme.svg).
See [this PR](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel/pull/4) for an example.
